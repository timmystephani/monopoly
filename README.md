# Monopoly Clone

## About

This is a clone of the monopoly game written in Rails using Bootstrap and jQuery mobile. There is currently a web UI that kind of works, and the beginnings of an iOS client. One of these years I may get around to working on this again. Ther are definitely some bugs and unfinished parts of the code.

I always wanted a native iOS and Android client to play passive Monopoly with others, and this was Dave Hand and myself's first crack at it. This was also together for a class, so don't look to it as an example of good code!
